% Compute the fill of the network, i.e., the proportion of possible
% edges that exist.  For networks with multiple edges, edge
% multiplicities are ignored. 
%
% Note: the definition of the fill in KONECT takes into account that
% loops are possible. 
%
% PARAMETERS 
%	A		Adjacency or biadjacency matrix
%	format		Format of the network
%	weights		Weights of the network 
%
% RESULT 
%	values		Column vector of values
%		[1] 	The fill, taking into account loops if they
%			are present
%		[2]	The fill, ignoring loops
