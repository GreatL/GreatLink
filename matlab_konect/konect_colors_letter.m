%%作图用到的颜色
% Colors used in various plots. 
%
% Each color represents the "side" from which an analysis is done. This
% is used in many different analyses, so the meaning depends on the
% analysis, but the overall structure is the same, so we use consistent
% colors.

% See the comments below for uses.
